# Cogs Docs

Cogs are to be setup into folders. The commands for each Cog are to be placed into
respective main.py files within each Cog folder.  
eg: The Utils Cog commands will be situated within **/src/cogs/utils/main.py**

This helps maintain standard and readability within each cog.  

## Current list of Cogs and their uses:  
TBD
