# Cogs Docs

Cogs are to be setup into folders. The commands for each Cog are to be placed into
respective main.py files within each Cog folder, main.py will also be the housing of the setup function for each Cog.  

eg: The Utils Cog commands will be situated within **/src/cogs/utils/main.py**

This helps maintain standard and readability within each cog.
